            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
              <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <header><h1>What You Should Already Know</h1></header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (www).</li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <header><h1>JavaScript and Java</h1></header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways, but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions, and basic control-flow constructs, which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a run-time system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not need to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not need to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

          <section id="hello-world" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Hello World</h1></header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code><br>
            <code>greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
          </section>
          <section id="variables" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Variables</h1></header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and "a" through "z" (lowercase).</li>
              <li>You can also use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Som examples of legal names are: Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="declaring-variables" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Declaring Variables</h1></header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p><b>With the keyword <kbd>var</kbd>.</b> For example:</p>
            <code>var x = 42;</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p><b>By simply assigning it a value.</b> For example:</p>
            <code>x = 42;</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p><b>With the keyword <kbd>let</kbd>.</b> For example:</p>
            <code>let x = 42;</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to create a block scope local variable. See "Variable Scope" for more information on what this means.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="variable-scope" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Variable Scope</h1></header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <em>global variable</em>, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a <em>local variable</em>, because it is only available within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function that block resides in (giving it a global scope). For example, the following code will log out "5" because the scope of x is the function, not the code block it resides in:</p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; }</code><br>
            <code>console.log(x); //5</code>
            <p>This behavior changes when using the <kbd>let</kbd> declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015:</p>
            <code>if (true) { let y = 5; }</code><br>
            <code>console.log(y); //Reference error: y is not defined</code>
            <p>This is because the <kbd>let</kbd> keyword is only accessible in the code block that it is declared in. Any calculations using y inside the if statement are valid, but nothing outside of the code block knows what y is.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="global-variables" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Global Variables</h1></header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is <kbd>window</kbd>, so you can set and access global variables using the <kbd>window.variable</kbd> syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying its name. For example, if a variable called <kbd>phoneNumber</kbd> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as <kbd>parent.phoneNumber</kbd>.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="constants" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Constants</h1></header>
            <p>You can create a read-only called a constant with the <kbd>const</kbd> keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier must obey the same rules as any other variable identifier.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It can only have the value it is initialized with.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="data-types" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Data Types</h1></header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Six primitive data types:
                <ul>
                  <li>Booleans; represents true and false.</li>
                  <li>null; a special keyword denoting a null value.</li>
                  <li>undefined; a top level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                  <li>Number; any integer or decimal value.</li>
                  <li>String; values denote characters or words.</li>
                  <li>Symbol; new to ECMAScript 2015. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="if-else-statement" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>if...else statement</h1></header>
            <p>Use the <kbd>if</kbd> statement to execute a code block if a logical condition is true. Use the optional <kbd>else</kbd> statement to execute a code block if the logical condition is false. An <kbd>if-else</kbd> statementlooks as follows:</p>
            <code>if (condition) { execute this code; } else { execute this code; }</code>
            <p><kbd>condition</kbd> can be any expression that evaluates as true or false. If the condition evaluates as true, the first code block will execute; if it evaluates as false, the second code block executes. The code block inside the if statement can be any statement or calculation, including functions and nested if statements.</p>
            <p>You may also compund the statement with else if to test for multiple conditions:</p>
            <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; }</code><br>
            <code>else if (condition_3) { statement_3; } else { final_statement; }</code>
            <p>When multiple conditions are being checked, only the first condition to evaluate as true will execute its code</p>
          </section>
          <section id="while-statement" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>while statement</h1></header>
            <p>A <kbd>while</kbd> statement executes for as long as a specified condition evaluates as true. This is also known as a <em>while loop</em>. A <kbd>while</kbd> statement looks as follows:</p>
            <code>while (condition) { statement; }</code>
            <p>If the condition becomes false, the statement within the loop stops executing and the script continues to the next statement.</p>
          </section>
          <section id="function-declaration" class="main-section">
            <header><h1>Function Declarations</h1></header>
            <p>A <em>function declaration</em> consists of the <kbd>function</kbd> keyword, followed by the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the name of the function</li>
              <li>a list of arguments to the function (also called <em>parameters</em>), enclosed in parenthesis and with each argument separated by a comma</li>
              <li>the JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets {}</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named <em>square</em>:</p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>This function takes one argument, called <kbd>number</kbd>. The function consists of one statement that says to return the value of the argument (number) multiplied by itself.</p>
            <p>Primitive parameters are passed to functions by value; the value is passed into the function's statement. The value of the parameter can be changed without changing any variables locally or globally, making functions highly flexible and reusable.</p>
